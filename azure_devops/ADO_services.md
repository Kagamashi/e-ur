## Most Important and Useful Information for **Azure DevOps Services and Tools**

### **9.1 Configuring Azure DevOps Projects and Repositories**

#### **Creating and Managing Azure DevOps Projects**
- Navigate to **Azure DevOps Organization** to create a new project.
- Choose between **public** and **private** visibility settings.
- Set up **default repositories** and pipeline configurations during project creation.

#### **Configuring Repositories**
- Use **Git** as the default version control system.
- Set up repository policies:
  - Require **pull requests** for code merges.
  - Enforce **branch protections** (e.g., code review requirements).
  - Enable **CI triggers** for automated builds on commits.
- Integrate external repositories (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) if needed.

#### **Best Practices for Repositories**
- Organize code into separate repositories for microservices.
- Use **README.md** files to document repository structure and purpose.
- Set up **repository permissions** using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

### **9.2 Managing Azure Boards for Work Tracking and Collaboration**

#### **Using Azure Boards for Agile Workflows**
- Create **work items** like Epics, Features, User Stories, and Tasks to break down project scope.
- Configure **Kanban boards** for visualizing workflows and tracking progress.
- Use **backlogs** to prioritize and organize work items.

#### **Collaborating with Teams**
- Assign work items to team members and set estimated completion times.
- Use **tags** to categorize and filter work items.
- Conduct **sprint planning** and monitor progress through **burndown charts**.

#### **Integration with Other Tools**
- Link work items to commits, pull requests, and builds for traceability.
- Use integrations with **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, or **Outlook** for notifications and updates.

### **9.3 Managing Test Plans and Test Cases in Azure Test Plans**

#### **Creating Test Plans**
- Define test plans to organize test cases by feature, sprint, or release.
- Associate test plans with corresponding **work items** to ensure coverage.

#### **Defining Test Cases**
- Write test cases with clear steps, expected results, and attachments if needed.
- Categorize test cases by **priority** and **type** (e.g., functional, regression).
- Use **shared steps** to avoid duplication across test cases.

#### **Test Execution and Reporting**
- Run manual tests and capture results directly in Azure Test Plans.
- Use **test configurations** to test across multiple environments or devices.
- Generate test result reports and track test coverage metrics.

### **9.4 Implementing Release Management Using Azure Pipelines**

#### **Setting Up Release Pipelines**
- Define release pipelines to automate deployment to different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
- Use **stages** to represent each environment and configure **approvals** between stages.

#### **Deployment Methods**
- Support various deployment strategies:
  - **Blue-Green Deployments**: Deploy to a separate environment and switch traffic.
  - **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of changes to a subset of users.
  - **Rolling Updates**: Incremental updates to avoid downtime.

#### **Managing Pipeline Approvals and Gates**
- Configure **pre-deployment approvals** for critical environments.
- Use **gates** to validate specific conditions (e.g., monitoring alerts, security checks) before proceeding.

#### **Monitoring and Rollback**
- Monitor deployments using **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights**.
- Set up automated rollback for failed deployments using pipeline conditions and scripts.

#### **Release Artifact Management**
- Manage release artifacts generated during the build process.
- Store artifacts securely in **Azure Artifacts** or **Blob Storage**.
- Version artifacts to ensure traceability and reproducibility of deployments.
