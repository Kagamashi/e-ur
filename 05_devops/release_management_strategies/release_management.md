#### **Setting Up Release Pipelines**
- Define release pipelines to automate deployment to different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
- Use **stages** to represent each environment and configure **approvals** between stages.

#### **Deployment Methods**
- Support various deployment strategies:
  - **Blue-Green Deployments**: Deploy to a separate environment and switch traffic.
  - **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of changes to a subset of users.
  - **Rolling Updates**: Incremental updates to avoid downtime.

#### **Managing Pipeline Approvals and Gates**
- Configure **pre-deployment approvals** for critical environments.
- Use **gates** to validate specific conditions (e.g., monitoring alerts, security checks) before proceeding.

#### **Monitoring and Rollback**
- Monitor deployments using **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights**.
- Set up automated rollback for failed deployments using pipeline conditions and scripts.

#### **Release Artifact Management**
- Manage release artifacts generated during the build process.
- Store artifacts securely in **Azure Artifacts** or **Blob Storage**.
- Version artifacts to ensure traceability and reproducibility of deployments.
