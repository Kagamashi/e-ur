## Key Principles of Operational Excellence

### **1. Design, Build, and Orchestrate with Modern Practices**
- Implement **DevOps and CI/CD** to automate deployments.
- Use **infrastructure as code (IaC)** for scalable, repeatable environments.
- Encourage **collaboration and transparency** across teams.

### **2. Use Monitoring and Analytics for Operational Insights**
- Establish **robust monitoring, logging, and instrumentation** systems.
- Detect **performance issues and cost inefficiencies** proactively.
- Correlate system events to **troubleshoot and optimize performance**.

### **3. Use Automation to Reduce Effort and Errors**
- Automate **resource deployment, scaling, and management**.
- Reduce manual intervention to **minimize errors and operational costs**.
- Enhance **efficiency and reliability** by scripting common operational tasks.

### **4. Implement a Strong Testing Strategy**
- Conduct **pre-deployment testing** to detect performance and security issues.
- Ensure **smooth communication** between dependent services.
- Identify **infrastructure weaknesses** that could affect user experience.
