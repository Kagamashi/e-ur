## Most Important and Useful Information for **Third-Party Tools Integration**

### **10.1 Integrating with GitHub Actions and GitHub Enterprise**

#### **GitHub Actions Integration**
- **Overview**: GitHub Actions enables workflow automation directly in GitHub repositories.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - Automating CI/CD pipelines.
  - Running tests and deploying applications.
- **Setting Up Workflows**:
  - Create YAML-based workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory.
  - Define triggers (e.g., `on: push`, `on: pull_request`) to start workflows.
- **Integration with Azure**:
  - Use GitHub Actions to deploy resources to Azure.
  - Leverage pre-built **Azure Actions** (e.g., `azure/login`, `azure/webapps-deploy`).

#### **GitHub Enterprise Integration**
- Provides enterprise-grade security, compliance, and management features.
- Integrate GitHub Enterprise with Azure DevOps to link work items, builds, and deployments.
- Use **GitHub Connect** to enable seamless workflows between GitHub and Azure environments.
