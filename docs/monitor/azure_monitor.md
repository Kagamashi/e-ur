## **1. Azure Monitor**

### **Overview of Azure Monitor and Its Components**
Azure Monitor provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry data from both cloud and on-premises environments. The key components include:

- **Metrics**: Numerical values that measure resource performance over time, such as CPU utilization or memory usage.
- **Logs**: Detailed records of system events and activities, stored in the Log Analytics workspace.
- **Alerts**: Notifications triggered based on specific conditions in metrics or logs.
- **Insights**: Preconfigured monitoring tools for specific Azure services, such as VM Insights, Container Insights, and Application Insights.

### **Key Features of Azure Monitor**
- **Data Collection**: Supports multiple sources including Azure resources, applications, and guest operating systems.
- **Data Analysis**: Enables real-time analysis and visualization of metrics and logs.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides recommendations and automated responses through alerts and integrations.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Power BI, Logic Apps, and third-party tools.

### **Configuring Data Sources for Azure Monitor**
1. **Enable Diagnostic Settings**
   - Navigate to the Azure resource (e.g., VM, Storage Account).
   - Under **Monitoring**, select **Diagnostic settings**.
   - Configure the logs and metrics to send to Log Analytics, Event Hub, or a storage account.

2. **Connect Applications**
   - Use **Application Insights** for application monitoring.
   - Install Application Insights SDK in your app to collect performance and usage data.

3. **Enable VM Monitoring**
   - Install the **Log Analytics agent** on virtual machines.
   - Connect the VM to a Log Analytics workspace.

4. **Monitor Containers**
   - Enable **Container Insights** to monitor AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).
   - Collect performance metrics, container logs, and kubelet metrics.

### **Setting Up and Managing Metrics Alerts**
1. **Create a Metrics Alert Rule**
   - Navigate to **Azure Monitor** > **Alerts** > **New alert rule**.
   - Select the target resource (e.g., a VM or storage account).
   - Choose a **Signal Type** (e.g., CPU Percentage).
   - Define the alert condition (e.g., greater than 80% for 5 minutes).
   - Set up an **Action Group** to notify via email, SMS, or webhook.

2. **Manage Alert Rules**
   - Use the **Alert rules** page to view, disable, or edit existing rules.
   - Configure alert severity levels to prioritize actions.

### **Configuring and Using Log Alerts**
1. **Create a Log Alert Rule**
   - Go to **Azure Monitor** > **Alerts** > **New alert rule**.
   - Select the Log Analytics workspace as the target resource.
   - Define a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query to filter log data.
   - Set alert conditions and thresholds.
   - Link an **Action Group** for notifications.

2. **Common Log Alert Scenarios**
   - Monitor failed login attempts for security insights.
   - Track application errors or exceptions.
   - Alert on resource health status changes.

### **Using Workbooks for Data Visualization and Analysis**
1. **Create a Workbook**
   - In **Azure Monitor**, select **Workbooks**.
   - Choose a pre-built template or start from scratch.
   - Add visualizations like charts, grids, and text blocks.

2. **Customize Workbooks**
   - Use KQL queries to pull specific metrics and logs.
   - Combine multiple data sources into a single view.
   - Share workbooks with your team for collaborative monitoring.

3. **Common Use Cases**
   - Performance tracking of VMs, databases, and applications.
   - Troubleshooting resource issues using historical data.
   - Creating dashboards for executive reporting.

### **Monitoring VMs, Containers, and Applications with Azure Monitor**
1. **Monitoring Virtual Machines**
   - Use **VM Insights** to monitor performance metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.
   - Analyze guest-level logs for detailed troubleshooting.

2. **Monitoring Containers**
   - Enable **Container Insights** to monitor pod performance, node health, and container logs.
   - Use Live Data (kubectl logs integration) for real-time container monitoring.

3. **Monitoring Applications**
   - Use **Application Insights** to monitor application dependencies, request/response times, and exceptions.
   - Analyze user behavior with built-in usage analytics.
   - Set up distributed tracing to monitor microservices.
