# ## Conditional Access
# Conditional Access policies enhance security by enforcing access requirements based on risk factors.

# ### **Key Features:**
# - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires users to verify identity with additional authentication (e.g., SMS, app, biometric).
# - **Block Legacy Authentication**: Prevents outdated protocols (e.g., POP, IMAP) from bypassing security policies.
# - **Require Compliant Devices**: Ensures that only devices meeting security policies (e.g., Intune-managed) can access resources.
# - **Risk-Based Conditional Access**: Integrates with **Azure AD Identity Protection** to evaluate user risk levels before granting access.

# **Use Conditional Access** to enforce secure access policies and mitigate identity-based threats.
