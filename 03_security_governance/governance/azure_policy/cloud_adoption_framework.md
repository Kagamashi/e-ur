## **Cloud Governance**
Cloud governance ensures **efficient cloud usage** while managing risks such as **compliance, security, costs, and resource management**.

### **5 Steps for Effective Cloud Governance**
1. **Build a Governance Team** – Establish a team to define and manage governance policies.
2. **Assess Cloud Risks** – Identify and evaluate risks (e.g., security, operations, compliance, AI-related risks).
3. **Document Cloud Governance Policies** – Create policies to define acceptable cloud usage.
4. **Enforce Policies** – Implement compliance monitoring and enforcement tools.
5. **Monitor Cloud Governance** – Continuously review and update policies based on evolving risks and technologies.

## **Key Considerations for Defining Cloud Governance Policies**
| Consideration        | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Business Risk**  | Identify and document evolving risks, aligning cloud use with business tolerance. |
| **Policy & Compliance** | Convert risk decisions into enforceable policies. |
| **Process** | Implement monitoring for policy adherence and violations. |

### **5 Core Disciplines of Cloud Governance**
1. **Cost Management** – Optimize IT expenses and align resources with demand.
2. **Security Baseline** – Enforce security compliance standards.
3. **Resource Consistency** – Standardize resource configurations and recovery processes.
4. **Identity Baseline** – Ensure consistent role-based access control (RBAC).
5. **Deployment Acceleration** – Streamline policy deployment with automation and standardization.

## **Azure Policy for Cloud Governance**
Azure Policy is the **primary governance tool** in Azure, enabling organizations to enforce compliance at scale.

### **Key Features of Azure Policy**
✅ **Centralized Compliance Management** – Tracks compliance status across all resources.
✅ **Automated Policy Enforcement** – Enforces policies to ensure security and operational consistency.
✅ **Bulk and Auto Remediation** – Fixes existing noncompliant resources and prevents future violations.
✅ **Integration with Azure DevOps** – Applies policies to CI/CD pipelines for governance at all stages.

### **Examples of Azure Policy Actions**
- Restrict resource deployments to specific Azure **Regions**.
- Enforce **geo-replication** for data residency compliance.
- Allow only **approved VM sizes**.
- Require **taxonomic tags** on all resources.
- Ensure all **servers receive security updates**.
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for user logins.
- Require **diagnostic logging** to be enabled.

### **How Azure Policy Works**
- Evaluates resources for compliance **before and after deployment**.
- Prevents creation of **noncompliant resources**.
- Provides **built-in policies** for storage, networking, security, and monitoring.
- Allows **exceptions** for specific resources when needed.

## **Balancing Governance and Speed**
- Governance should not hinder agility.
- A **balanced approach** ensures compliance **without impacting innovation**.
- Organizations should carefully evaluate **policy impact before implementation**.
