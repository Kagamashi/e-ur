## Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) Summary

### Overview
Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Azure ensures secure authentication and authorization for users, applications, and devices. A strong IAM solution provides unified identity management, adaptive security, simplified governance, and a seamless user experience.

#### Key IAM Principles:
- **Unified Identity Management:** Manage identities centrally for cloud and on-premises applications.
- **Seamless User Experience:** Provide fast and easy sign-in while reducing password-related issues.
- **Secure Adaptive Access:** Enforce strong authentication and risk-based policies.
- **Simplified Identity Governance:** Control access through automated identity governance.

### Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
Microsoft Entra ID is Azure’s IAM solution that integrates directory services, application access management, and identity protection.

#### Features:
- Supports **cloud-only** or **hybrid** identity models.
- Offers **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), conditional access, and access reviews**.
- Extends **on-premises Active Directory to Azure** via Entra Connect or cloud sync.

#### Best Practices:
- **Centralized Identity Management:** Manage accounts from a single location.
- **Use a Single Entra Instance:** Reduce complexity and security risks.
- **Limit High-Privilege Synchronization:** Protect high-privilege accounts.
- **Enable Password Hash Sync:** Prevent credential leaks.
- **Implement Single Sign-On (SSO):** Reduce password fatigue and improve security.
- **Minimize Separate Identities:** Avoid overhead and security risks from multiple identity stores.

### Microsoft Entra Business-to-Business (B2B)
Microsoft Entra B2B enables secure collaboration with external partners by inviting them as guest users.

#### Key Features:
- Partners use their own identity provider (no need to manage external credentials).
- Guest users access assigned applications via email invitation.
- Supports **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for extra security.
- Enforces **conditional access policies** to regulate guest access.

#### Best Practices:
- **Delegate Guest User Management:** Assign app owners to handle guest access.
- **Implement Conditional Access:** Enforce access controls beyond passwords.
- **Leverage Identity Providers:** Allow users to sign in via social or enterprise accounts.
- **Use Self-Service Sign-Up:** Enable automated onboarding for B2B users.

### Microsoft Entra Business-to-Customer (B2C)
Microsoft Entra B2C provides identity management for customer applications, separate from an organization’s internal Entra directory.

#### Key Features:
- Supports **multiple identity providers** (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Facebook).
- Provides **custom user journeys** for registration and authentication.
- Stores **customer attributes** for personalized application experiences.
- Offers **custom UI branding** for sign-in and registration pages.
- Allows integration with **external user stores** for advanced authentication.

#### Best Practices:
- **Reuse User Flows:** Maintain consistency across different apps.
- **Support Social Logins:** Reduce barriers to user sign-in.
- **Customize Branding:** Provide a seamless and branded user experience.
- **Integrate with External Systems:** Store user data in external CRMs if needed.
